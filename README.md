# Rails 6.1 with Tailwind CSS 3

This is a Rails 6.1 template with Tailwind CSS 3.0.0, RSpec and Devise installed and configured.

It also includes a few other gems that I find useful for Rails development.

## Prerequisites

This template utilizes VSCode's remote development containers to provide a consistent development environment. If you don't have VSCode installed, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

- Docker
- VSCode
- VSCode Remote Development Container Extension

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo
2. Open the project in VSCode
3. Open the command palette (CMD + Shift + P) and select "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container"
4. Wait for container to build and install dependencies
5. Run `./bin/dev` to start the server and Tailwind CSS watcher

## Notes

- Ruby version 3.1.2

- System dependencies - Docker - VSCode - VSCode Remote Development Container Extension

- How to run the test suite - `bundle exec rspec`

- Deployment instructions - `./bin/dev` to start the server and Tailwind CSS watcher
